# Documentation Index

This folder contains categorized documentation for the WGS pipeline.

## Architecture

- [Codebase Overview](architecture/codebase-overview.md)

## Guides

- [Getting Started](guides/getting-started.md)
- [Troubleshooting](guides/troubleshooting.md)

## Reference

- [Sample Registry](reference/sample-registry.md)
- [Dependency Policy](../DEPENDENCIES.md)

## Conventions

- Keep docs under `docs/` by category (`architecture/`, `guides/`, `reference/`).
- Root-level markdown files should be limited to high-signal entry points (for example `README.md` and `DEPENDENCIES.md`).
- Update docs in the same PR as behavior changes.
