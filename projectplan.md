### üìà Impact Assessment

The improvements have transformed this from a specialist tool requiring bioinformatics expertise into an accessible pipeline for users comfortable with command-line tools but new to genomics:

**Before**: Users needed to understand technical error messages, manually manage configurations, and have deep knowledge of bioinformatics tools

**After**: Users can validate their system, download test data, run analyses with sensible defaults, and get clear guidance when issues arise

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Comprehensive error handling** - Most user frustration eliminated
2. **Clear documentation hierarchy** - Users can find appropriate help level
3. **Sample data availability** - Immediate validation without large downloads
4. **Flexible configuration** - Adaptable to different use cases and systems

This pipeline is now ready for public use by researchers, students, and practitioners who want to analyze genomic data without requiring extensive bioinformatics training.
